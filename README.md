Murmur learning project
This is the code for the murmur project I completed. This project's primary focus was to help me learn more advanced python programming such as object-orientation.
The secondary focus of this project was to create an environment where boids algorithm could be implemented in 2D. This is not intended to be a completely accurate recreation of the boids algorithm and DOES have issues (such as over-cohesion).
